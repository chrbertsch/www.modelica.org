MSL is a free, open-source library providing a comprehensive set of standardized model components for a wide range of physical domains.
This release builds upon the foundation of version 4.0.0 and incorporates significant improvements, new features, and bug fixes while maintaining backward compatibility for user models. 
This means users can seamlessly upgrade to version 4.1.0 without requiring model conversions.

##Key Highlights of Modelica Standard Library 4.1.0:

- **New Components**: Introducing 17 new components, including Blocks for recording the minimum and maximum values of a signal, further expanding the library's capabilities.
- **Improved Components**: Enhancing existing functionality with 12 improved components, such as enabling tables to read CSV files for increased data flexibility.
- **Small Non-Backwards-Compatible Changes**: Carefully considered changes impacting primarily constant definitions (Constants.inf, Constants.small, Constants.eps) which users are advised to review.
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressing 26 identified bugs, leading to more accurate and reliable simulation results. Note that these fixes may impact simulation results compared to previous versions.
- **Obsolete Models**: Marking 3 models as obsolete to promote the use of newer, more efficient alternatives.

Based on Modelica 3.6: Built upon the latest Modelica language standard version 3.6, ensuring compatibility with modern Modelica tools.
 
This release represents a collaborative effort, incorporating contributions from across the Modelica community. 
Approximately **560 issues have been addressed** for this release, including **392 pull requests**, demonstrating the active and vibrant nature of the Modelica ecosystem.
